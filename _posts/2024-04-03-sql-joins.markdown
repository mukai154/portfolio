description: As part of Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, this project simulates a real-world scenario involving a fictional small bookstore business. I was tasked with analyzing sales and employee data using SQL. All data queries and analysis were conducted through MySQL Workbench, focusing on data integrity, relational structure, and secure access practices aligned with cybersecurity principles.
